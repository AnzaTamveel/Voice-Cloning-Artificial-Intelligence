# Voice-Cloning-Artificial-Intelligence

This repository contains the code and implementation for our research paper titled **"End-to-End Voice Cloning System Using Multi-Speaker TTS Models"**.

The project utilizes a pre-trained multilingual TTS model (YourTTS) along with a speaker encoder (Resemblyzer) to perform high-quality, zero-shot voice cloning from a short reference audio sample.

## Features

- Voice cloning from < 1 second of reference audio
- Multilingual TTS synthesis
- Speaker identity preservation using cosine similarity
- Real-time inference performance

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anzatamveel/Voice-Cloning-Artificial-Intelligence.git
   cd Voice-Cloning-Artificial-Intelligence
